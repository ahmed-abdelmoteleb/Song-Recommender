You have been hired as a Data Analyst for "Goldfinch".

"Gnod" is a site that provides recommendations for music, art, literature and products based on collaborative filtering algorithms. Their flagship product is the music recommender, which you can try at www.gnoosic.com. The site asks users to input 3 bands they like, and computes similarity scores with the rest of the users. Then, they recommend to the user bands that users with similar tastes have picked.

"Goldfinch" is a small company, and its only revenue stream so far are adds in the site. In the future, they would like to explore partnership options with music apps (such as Deezer, Soundcloud or even Apple Music and Spotify). However, for that to be possible, they need to expand and improve their recommendations.

That's precisely where you come. They have hired you as a Data Analyst, and they expect you to bring a mix of technical expertise and business mindset to the table.

Jane, CTO of Gnod, has sent you an email assigning you with your first task.
